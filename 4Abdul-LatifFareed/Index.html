	<p class="thin"><img id= "i1" src = "Images/Sillyp.jpg" />I live in Georgia within <a href= "https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/web/gwinnett/Home" target = "blank"> Gwinnett County</a>. I am currently enrolled at GSMST (The Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology) 
	where (as of writing this) I am in my second year as a sophomore at the school. Throughout my years of schooling, I have attended many different
	schools, including La Petite Academy, Peachtree Elementary School, McConnell Middle School (for one year), Pinckneyville Middle School
	(for the remainder of middle school), and (currently) GSMST. Additionally, my favorite color is blue and my favorite fruits are mangoes, strawberries,
	apples, peaches, and pineapples. I like wearing jackets and I almost never leave my house without wearing one. Furthermore, I am not very tall, wear glasses,
	and am in dire need of a haircut. I also do not own any pets, and every plant I have ever tried to keep has ended up dying within a month. Currently,
	I am 16 years old, but I will turn 17 this year in <span class= "highlight"> October.</span> I have lived in Georgia all my life, and I do not plan on changing that fact any time soon.</p>
	
	<h3 id= "Fam">Family</h3>
	<p class="thin"><img id="i2" src = "Images/Accra.jpg" />I live in a small apartment with my family. There are four members of my immediate family, which, excluding me, include my mother, my father, and my sister.
	My parents are from <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana" target = "blank"> Ghana</a>, so my sister and I are first generation Americans due to the act that we were born within this country. In addition, I am the older 
	sibling by about two years. Most of my external family members are in Ghana, and I plan on visiting them one day. Some of my relatives live in America as well 
	consisting of a fair number of uncles and aunts. Since I do not speak any of the native languages within my country, it can be quite difficult to communicate with 
	certain family members that are not a part of my immediate family, but, fortunately for me and my sister, many of them do speak English at least to a certain extent. 
	In addition, I have never met my grandparents, which I now only have two of since the ones on my father’s side have passed. My grandfather on my dad’s side was often 
	called the “chief” since he was quite wealthy during his lifetime and owned some amount of property and many cars. Furthermore, my great grandfather on my mother’s side 
	was a notable politician who served in the <span class= "highlight"> Nkrumah regime</span> back in Ghana from the mid to late 1900s. One of my biggest hopes is to someday be able to connect better with my 
	external family. </p>
	
	<h3 id= "Hob">Hobbies</h3>
	<p id="P3"><img id= "i3" src = "Images/Xboox.jpg" />One of my favorite things to do is to <span class= "highlight"> play video games.</span> I mostly play on consoles with my first console technically being a pre-owned PS2 which my mom and aunt were scammed
	into buying (under the assumption that it was a PS3) as it did not work and none of the games did either. My first real console, however, was an xbox 360, which, despite being
	quite dated and obsolete, has served me well over the years. Currently, I have an <a href= "https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-one/consoles/products/xbox-one-s-white-1tb/10138875.html" target = "blank"> Xbox one S</a> 
	which is the console I primarily use with some of my favorite games including Warframe, Battlefield I, Risk of Rain 2, and Injustice 1&2. When I was younger, I also used to read a lot.
	Although it is something that I still enjoy, reading is something that I do not really do as often as I want anymore. Quite recently, however, I have been learning how to cook, and,
	although I am quite amateur, cooking is something that I enjoy and want to get better at. Currently, I can make a few different types of meals such as various stews and several rice variants,
	but I can also make other miscellaneous things such as pancakes and donuts. Lastly, one of my lesser-practiced hobbies involves building things and fixing items that are broken. Years ago when 
	I was a kid, I would take certain items apart, whether it be toys, electronics, or anything else, for fun and break them in the process. Depending on what I wanted to do from there, I would try to 
	fix these items or modify them with the tools that I had on hand until I was either satisfied with what I did, got bored of what I was doing, or simply gave up. When I got older,
	I took a liking to building things like furniture and fixing things that were broken such as electronics, utensils, and even pens. Although I perform these activities only
	occasionally, I still find them enjoyable nevertheless.  </p>
